#Acknowledgements#

RepoTheWeb takes advantage of several great resources out on the web, and the people listed here should take pride in having contributed to what we believe is the next leap in the Web, website integration. 

They're listed here in case their sites go down before us, which we hope wouldn't happen. The URLs these resources originated are documented inline. 

##Icon Artists##

- [Yummy Gum](http://yummygum.com/) (Leon Ephraim & Vince Swiddler) -- config favicon (/www/repotheweb.org/config.ico).
- [Picol](http://www.picol.org/) (Melih Bilgil & Co.) -- select service favicon (/www/repotheweb.org/select.ico).
- [Cyber Tourniquet](http://www.cybertourniquet.com/) (he only says "Dan") -- no favicon icon (/www/repotheweb.org/nofavicon.ico)

	Got it off his homepage, obviously an image search.

Yummy Gum & Picol both distribute on findicons.com, so it should get mentioned. 

##Libraries##

- [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/) -- jQuery and micro-templating (embedded in /www/repotheweb.org/utils.js)
- [Toby Ho](http://tobyho.com/) -- OnReady.js (/src/onready.js)
- [James Burke](http://tagneto.blogspot.co.nz/) -- Require.js (lib/r.js) and Almond.js (lib/almond.js)

##Hackers##

Last, but not least, are the people who brought these together:

- Austin King "ozten" -- Project Manager
- Adrian Cochrane "alcinnz" -- Major initial work
