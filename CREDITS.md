#Acknowledgements#

RepoTheWeb takes advantage of several great resources out on the web, and the people listed here should take pride in having contributed to what we believe is the next leap in the Web, website integration. 

They're listed here in case their sites go down before us, which we hope wouldn't happen. The URLs these resources originated are documented inline. 

##Icon Artists##

- [Yummy Gum](http://yummygum.com/) (Leon Ephraim & Vince Swiddler) -- config favicon (/www/repotheweb.org/config.ico).
- [Picol](http://www.picol.org/) (Melih Bilgil & Co.) -- select service favicon (/www/repotheweb.org/select.ico).
- "austintheheller" (site's down already) -- [no favicon icon](http://www.veryicon.com/icons/system/august/) (/www/repotheweb.org/select.ico).
- [GentleFace.com](http://gentleface.com/) (no About Us) -- bookmark favicon (/www/repotheweb.org/bookmark.ico)

Yummy Gum, Picol, and GentleFace.com all distribute on findicons.com, so it deserves to get mentioned.
