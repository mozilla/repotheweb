#RepoTheWeb Translation (l10n)#

To translate RepoTheWeb into a new language

1. Copy en.i18n from this directory and name it the 2 letter ISO code (lowercase) for the new language. 
2. Edit text after the colon on each line (leaving the double quotes surrounding it and comma). 

  %s is used as sequential placeholders for information.

Do not translate the text before the colon on each line, they are referenced in code and must stay the same.

Protocol, if it changes your translation, refers to the part of the web address (technically called URL) before the colon (:), which defers *slightly* from the selection of Internet protocols. It is used loosely so as not to alienate users.
