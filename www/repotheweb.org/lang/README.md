#RepoTheWeb Translation (l10n)#

To translate RepoTheWeb into a new language

1. Copy en.i18n from this directory and name it the 2 letter code (lowercase) for the new language. 
2. Edit text after the colon on each line (leaving the double quotes surrounding it and comma). 

  %s is used as sequential placeholders for information.

Do not translate the text before the colon on each line, they are referenced in code and must stay the same.
