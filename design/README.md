#Configuration Screen Design#

I, "alcinnz", recently discussed UI design on this project. The conclusion I came to was that the configuration screen could not be designed inline with normal development, that a mockup was called for. This directory is a drop box for design ideas. 

The select screen, however can be done inline with normal development and I have already implemented improvements for the desktop. 

##To Start, what have I ("alcinnz") done on the select screen##

The themes of the select screen are intermediary and link selection. Before my improvements, it was kind of communicating the link selection theme. I've clarified the links with more whitespace and domain names in place of template URLs. As for intermediary page, I styled the page like an exageration of a lightbox, but without tying it to either page. This should communcate it's between pages as it visually doesn't belong to either page, but neither does it belong to itself. 

However, the design is wasteful of space (because it didn't use that much anyways) and mobile users will be far from pleased. Perhaps some Responsive Web Design?

##Why?##

In development, we'll expose ourselves to limited demos. This does not reflect what is likely to be the case, in that users will have registered several schemes. The config screen needs to be scalable. In order to do that we need to play with varying degrees of content while designing this/these pages. 

##Plans##

I've already asked a friend, Nick Sussmilch "kingsussmilch", to compile the content. 

We'll also have to brainstorm some UI ideas/metaphors to help them manage this content. 

From there, I don't know.
